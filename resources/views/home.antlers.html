          <p class="lead">Frontend, backend, fullstack... whatever you want to call it. I just love to build stuff for the web. Whether it's code or content, I'm always driven to be as optimistic as possible to make sure that every engagment I have with a client, fellow developer, or anyone really, is positive and memorable!</p>
          <p>Sweating the details is what I do best. I love working with clients to bring their ideas to life and create something that is not only visually stunning but also highly functional and user-friendly. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.</p>

                <p>Aside from coding and development, I love to travel with my family! We've been from Hawaii all the way to Amsterdam with a bunch of stops in between. Our goal is to travel around the entire globe and visit as many places as we can. I love music! I've played guitar and been in bands since I was about 10 years old. I love sports (Jazz, 49ers, SF Giants, Real Salt Lake) and going to sporting events.</p>
                <p>I absolutely love building for the web. The freedom and expresiveness of web platforms gives me the ability to create anything I can think of. I'm lucky enough to be a Laravel developer. My goal is to become more of a teacher and mentor in the dev-space. I understand how tough it can be getting into development and learning the ins and outs, and I love when I can help someone else get to their next level of programming.</p>

As an Account Manager words cannot express how comforting it is to have a client-facing developer like Zack who can jump on any call, or attend any meeting, and provide answers that show the customer that they can have confidence in Zack and his team. This duel threat of unparalleled skill + client-facing capacity is rare in the development world. Zack is one-of-a-kind.</p>
                        <p>On top of already possessing in-depth knowledge and having a full 40+ hour work week, Zack finds time outside of work to sharpen his saw and scoop up new development knowledge on his own time. Every time we're looking for new approaches to development or animation Zack has answers and insights into what's possible and he's willing to try anything. Zack never ceases to amaze me.</p>

                        <p>Zack is absolutely great to work with! I've worked with a lot of developers who would be very stuck in their ways or make you feel inferior for not understanding their code, but Zack was never like that. Whatever request a client would make, he always gave incredible insight into what it would take to reach that goal with a great "can-do" outlook and using terms that us normal people could understand. If I could work with a "Zack" at every company, I would!</p>

                        <p>Zack is a rare find. You don’t often find developers that are as business smart as Zack, but also know how to develop and write code the way he does. He is also very solution oriented and never focuses on the problem, as a business owner that is all you can ask for and Zack does it better than anybody I’ve met.</p>
