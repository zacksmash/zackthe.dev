          <p class="lead">I'm a full-stack developer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. I specialize in building web applications and websites using PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS. I'm passionate about creating clean, maintainable code and delivering high-quality products that exceed my clients' expectations.</p>
          <p>Sweating the details is what I do best. Whether it's code or content, I'm always driven to be as optimistic as possible to make sure that every engagment I have with a client, fellow developer -- or anyone really -- is positive and memorable! I love working with clients to bring their ideas to life and create something that is not only visually stunning but also highly functional and user-friendly. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.</p>

                <p>My current goal is working toward learning Swift and SwiftUI. Getting in to something that's completely outside of my realm of confortablity is where I feel like I need to be, at this point. The iOS ecosystem is interesting to me, given the popularity (obviously), but also the concept of "Build once, run on any Apple platform". This concept is familiary to me, as I've built apps using the Ionic Framework, which is known for it's similar concepts.</p>

                <p>I'm working on becoming better with Shopify themes. I've built out my own starting framework for Shopify, using TailwindCSS and AlpineJS. I'm also working on a few projects that will be released as open source, to help other developers get up and running with Shopify, faster.</p>

                <p>I'm currently working on becoming a better tester. I feel like I've been pretty good at writing convential tests, in PHPUnit, but moving to Pest has been very helpful. I'm also working on becoming a better frontend tester, using Vitest, as well as using tools like Cypress.</p>

                        <strong>over 10,000</strong>
                        installs, FortifyUI is by far my most popular and successfuly venture into open source. FortifyUI installs and configures Laravel Fortify, as well as adding the features that Fortify doesn't come with, out of the box. By default and by design FortifyUI has unstyled templates, just plain ol' HTML, which gives the developer the ability to style them according to the design they have.

                        After building FortifyUI, I also wanted to create a preset installation for one of the CSS frameworks I use, called UIkit. This also made me think that other people may want to use FortifyUI, but install their own CSS Framework. So, I created the

                        <p>Zack is everything you want in a Developer - his expert skill and in-depth development knowledge allows Fluid to build any project thrown our way and answer any curveball questions that we receive. As an Account Manager words cannot express how comforting it is to have a client-facing developer like Zack who can jump on any call, or attend any meeting, and provide answers that show the customer that they can have confidence in Zack and his team. This duel threat of unparalleled skill + client-facing capacity is rare in the development world. Zack is one-of-a-kind.</p>
                        <p>On top of already possessing in-depth knowledge and having a full 40+ hour work week, Zack finds time outside of work to sharpen his saw and scoop up new development knowledge on his own time. Every time we're looking for new approaches to development or animation Zack has answers and insights into what's possible and he's willing to try anything. Zack never ceases to amaze me.</p>

I've worked with a lot of developers who would be very stuck in their ways or make you feel inferior for not understanding their code, but Zack was never like that. Whatever request a client would make, he always gave incredible insight into what it would take to reach that goal with a great "can-do" outlook and using terms that us normal people could understand. If I could work with a "Zack" at every company, I would!</p>
